# 📌 Regularization Techniques: Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet

Welcome to the **Regularization Techniques** project! This repository explores the concepts and implementations of Ridge Regression (L2), Lasso Regression (L1), and ElasticNet (a combination of L1 and L2) in Python. These techniques are essential for preventing overfitting and improving model generalization in machine learning.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Regularization_Techniques.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation, explanations, and visualizations.  
- `Advertising.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (sales vs TV, radio, newspaper ad spending) 

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:  
- Understand the theory behind Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization.  
- Implement these techniques using Python and scikit-learn.  
- Compare their performance on real-world datasets.  
- Learn how to tune hyperparameters (e.g., alpha, lambda) for optimal results.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – For implementing Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models  
- **SciPy** – For additional statistical support  

## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

- **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Understand the bias-variance tradeoff.  
- **Regularization**: Learn how L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties work.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize alpha (λ) for model performance.  
- **Feature Selection**: See how Lasso promotes sparsity by shrinking coefficients to zero.  
- **ElasticNet**: Combine L1 and L2 penalties for balanced regularization.  

## 💼 Use Case

Regularization is widely used in:  
- Linear regression tasks with high-dimensional data.  
- Feature selection (especially Lasso).  
- Improving model generalization in machine learning pipelines.
